# hello-world
Well, hello everyone and welcome to another hello-world repository, this is just for testing so i think it won't matter :')
This is just a test of another repository, I'm still learning how to work on github, so i have this web project, which I'm leading, that it must be done in laravel (i've never used laravel before) so i have to finish it in 2 months, yey!
So I'm learning github with my friends and that's it, if someone see this, wish me luck :D
